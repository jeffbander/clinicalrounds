# ClinicalRounds

**Instant AI-powered multidisciplinary case review for complex inpatients.**

Paste a clinical note. 9 AI specialists analyze in parallel, cross-consult each other, and synthesize a unified Assessment & Plan -- in under 60 seconds.

No database. No login. No PHI storage. Just paste and go.

## The Problem

Complex hospitalized patients need multidisciplinary input. A real team conference means coordinating cardiology, nephrology, hematology, pharmacy, and more -- days of scheduling, hours of rounding. Most patients never get one.

ClinicalRounds gives every patient an instant multidisciplinary review.

## How It Works

### 1. Paste Your Note
Copy any clinical note from your EHR -- H&P, progress note, consult, discharge summary. No login. No integration. Just paste.

### 2. 9 Specialists Analyze in Parallel
All specialists review simultaneously from their domain perspective. They cross-consult each other, flag critical findings, and ask you for missing data.

### 3. Copy the A/P
Get a unified Assessment & Plan organized by problem, with specialist-attributed recommendations, validated scoring systems, and guideline citations. One-click copy into your note.

## The Specialist Team

| Specialist | Focus Areas | Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Attending Hospitalist** | Systems-based assessment, care coordination, risk stratification, disposition | Opus |
| **Cardiology** | ACS evaluation, heart failure, arrhythmia, hemodynamics, GDMT optimization | Sonnet |
| **Pulm / Critical Care** | Ventilator management, ABG interpretation, ARDS, respiratory failure | Sonnet |
| **Nephrology** | Electrolytes, AKI staging, acid-base, dialysis assessment, CKD management | Sonnet |
| **Hepatology** | Liver function, cirrhosis, MELD scoring, hepatic encephalopathy | Sonnet |
| **Hematology** | Coagulopathy, transfusion medicine, anticoagulation, DIC evaluation | Sonnet |
| **Infectious Disease** | Antimicrobial stewardship, culture interpretation, empiric coverage | Sonnet |
| **Radiology** | Imaging correlation, incidental findings, follow-up recommendations | Sonnet |
| **Clinical Pharmacy** | Drug interactions, renal/hepatic dosing, medication reconciliation | Sonnet |
| **Endocrinology** | Glycemic management, thyroid, adrenal, inpatient insulin protocols | Sonnet |
| **Neurology** | Altered mental status, stroke, seizure, neuromuscular assessment | Sonnet |

## What Makes This Different

**Not a chatbot.** ClinicalRounds runs a structured 4-stage clinical reasoning pipeline, not a single-prompt Q&A.

**Cross-consultation.** Specialists don't analyze in isolation. Hematology asks cardiology about anticoagulation risk in low-EF patients. Nephrology flags drug dosing concerns for pharmacy. Conflicts between specialists are surfaced, not hidden.

**Asks for missing data.** Specialists identify gaps in the clinical picture and generate targeted questions. Provide additional data and the entire team re-analyzes with the new information.

**Scoring systems.** Each specialist applies validated clinical scoring tools (HEART, Wells, MELD-Na, CURB-65, CHA2DS2-VASc, etc.) and shows their work.

**Problem-oriented output.** The final synthesis is organized by clinical problem with specialist-attributed recommendations -- ready to paste into an A/P section.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20+
- An [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/)

### Install and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jeffbander/clinicalrounds.git
cd clinicalrounds

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set your API key
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local and add your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Yes | Your Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) |

### API Key Cost

ClinicalRounds makes 11 parallel Claude API calls per case (9 specialists + intake parser + attending synthesis), plus cross-consultation rounds. A typical case review costs approximately $0.50-$2.00 in API usage depending on note length and complexity.

### Design Decisions

- **No database.** All state lives in React. Sessions are ephemeral. Close the tab and everything is gone.
- **No auth.** No user accounts, no login, no registration. Open and use.
- **No PHI storage.** Clinical text exists only in browser memory during the session. Nothing is logged, cached, or persisted.
- **Parallel execution.** All specialists run simultaneously via `Promise.all()`. No sequential bottleneck.
- **Streaming.** Both analysis and synthesis stream results via SSE for real-time UI updates.
- **Opus for synthesis, Sonnet for specialists.** The attending physician uses Opus for the final synthesis where reasoning quality matters most. All domain specialists use Sonnet for speed and cost efficiency.

### Self-Hosted

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```

Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in your environment. The app runs on port 3000 by default.

### Docker

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 3000
ENV NODE_ENV=production
CMD ["npm", "start"]
